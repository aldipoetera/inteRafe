# inteRafe: ggiraph cross-interactivity utilities

This is going to be my little project as a hobby to utilize cross-interactivity across ggiraph graphs easy and quick (although not that quick); I don't have any specific direction so far other than additive filters. Documentation follows later as I'm adding more features, release if I feel like it
